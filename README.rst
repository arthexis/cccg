Sigils - Collectible Children's Card Game
=========================================

This repository contains the very first scaffolding for a collectible card game
prototype powered by `pygame <https://www.pygame.org>`_.

Running the prototype
---------------------

Install the project in editable mode and launch the ``sigils`` console script::

   pip install -e .
   sigils --width 1600 --height 900 --fps 120

The current implementation only opens an empty window with a placeholder
background colour. Future iterations will introduce gameplay systems,
animations and assets.
