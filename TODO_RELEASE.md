Release Manager TODO - Love2D UI regression
-------------------------------------------

Use these steps to manually exercise the new Love2D port in ``love2d/``:

1. Launch the build with ``love .`` from the ``love2d`` directory.
2. Click the deck to spawn several cards; confirm the counter decreases.
3. Drag a card onto another to create a stack, then Ctrl+drag a card to detach it.
4. Drag the playfield background to pan the camera; use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out.
5. Drop a card near the bottom of the window and confirm it snaps into the curved hand layout.
6. Press Escape to reset the camera focus back to the origin.
